## Example for bass management 5.1
## not optimized for 192khz. perfectly ok for 96khz
## each output to dac statement can be replaced by outputvolsat to avoid any risk of saturation
## the LFE channel is increaded by 10db, another possibility is to reduce each other channels by -10db of course
## each channel is going trough an LR4 crossover and is considered as "small"
## the low pass part of the signal is sent to the SUB channel.

## DAC output assignement

L		0
R		1
C		2
SUB		3
LS		4
RS		5

## USB inputs definition

Lin			16
Rin			17
Cin			18

## key frequencies for individual crossover (large/small)

F_CROSS		80		# individual crossover large/small
F_LFE		120		# LFE channel limit

## filter for crossover between speakers and SUB

LP_CROSS	LPLR4( F_CROSS )
HP_CROSS	HPLR4( F_CROSS )
AP_CROSS	AP2( F_CROSS, 0.7)

## low pass for limiting LFE channel

LP_LFE		LPLR4( F_LFE )

## filters definition for each output including some optional PEQ correction (set at 0db by default)

F_L		HPLR4( F_CROSS ) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(2000, 0.7, 0db) 
F_R		HPLR4( F_CROSS ) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(2000, 0.7, 0db) 
F_C		HPLR4( F_CROSS ) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(2000, 0.7, 0db) 
F_LS	HPLR4( F_CROSS ) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(2000, 0.7, 0db) 
F_RS	HPLR4( F_CROSS ) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(2000, 0.7, 0db) 

F_SUB	PEAK(80, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(100, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(120, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(160, 0.7, 0db) 

## bank of delays given in microseconds to correct speaker distance at listening point
## each value should be computed based on 343m/seconds and the value should be relative to the farest speaker.
## example : if farest is at 4m from listening position (example mains L & R)) and if center is at 3.8m
## then the center should be delayed by (4-3.8)/343*1000000 = 583us
