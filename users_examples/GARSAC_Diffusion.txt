## Example for GARSAC Diffusion, 3 ways + Sub
## replacing a DSP408

## used to differentiate dsp program inputs channels according to input selection
PureUSB		x03
PureAES		x08

## key transition frequencies for crossover

f_hp_sub	25		#high pass frequency for sub
f_lp_sub	111		#low  pas  frequency for sub

f_hp_low	111		#high pass frequency for low
f_lp_low	691		#low  pas  frequency for low

f_hp_mid	691		#high pass frequency for mid
f_lp_mid	6500	#low  pas  frequency for mid

f_hp_high	691		#high pass frequency for high
#no stop frequencies for high

## DAC output assignement

sub_left 	0
sub_right	1
low_left	2
low_right	3
mid_left	4
mid_right	5
high_left	6
high_right	7

## AES or USB inputs assignement

inA			16
inB			17
inC			18	#not used
inD			19  #not used

## these filters are applied on the incoming signal, before crossover. 4 biquads each.
## it is recommended to apply the same treatment to keep phase consistent between left and right

filt_left	HS2(300, 0.6, -11.5db) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db)
filt_right	HS2(300, 0.6, -11.5db) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db) PEAK(1000, 0.7, 0db)

## each of these filter below takes 8 biquads in total. PEQ with 0db is same as a passtrough or bypass
## the filter starts with the HighPass filter , then some PEQ, then Lowpass
## same filter for left and right to ensure phase consistency, but possibility to change that of course

## delay between drivers described in millimetter . 
## consider applying a difference instead of absolute distance, 
## to minimize resulting value in microsec

## value below in millimetter, relative to the FAREST one so that it is POSITIVE only.
